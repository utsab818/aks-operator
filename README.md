# aks-operator
This code is part of a Kubernetes operator designed to manage Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. The operator utilizes Kubebuilder to create a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) called AKSCluster. The CRD allows Kubernetes users to define and manage AKS clusters directly from within their Kubernetes environment.

This is for learning purpose.
